There are benign, mature teratomas composed of elements of all three embryonic germ layers. Complete surgical excision is essential to reduce local recurrence. Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric abdominal malignancy. Neuroblastomas arise from the neural crest and these tumors occur in the adrenal medulla and paravertebral sympathetic chain in the chest and abdomen. Children present with regional or distant metastases at time of diagnosis. In children under 12 months of age, neuroblastoma may undergo spontaneous regression. The most common site for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma are the head and neck, genitourinary tract, and the extremities. Favorable prognosis is associated with age under 10 years, and tumors of the orbit or nonparameningeal head and neck, genitourinary, and biliary tract. Smaller tumor size and absence of metastatic disease are also associated with a more favorable prognosis. Ewing's sarcoma is generally associated with a worse prognosis. Wilms' tumor or nephroblastoma is a malignant renal tumor that occurs most frequently in 1- to 5-year-old children. It often presents with a palpable abdominal mass and may involve imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and and duplex ultrasonography are useful in identifying tumor thrombus in the renal vein and/or inferior vena cava."

Postpolypectomy syndrome is the second most common, occurring after 0.5% to 1.0% of all polypectomies. Risk factors include sessile polyps > 2 cm and polyps removed from the right colon. The syndrome results from transmural burn without actual perforation. Postpolypectomy syndrome presents like a colonic perforation, with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. It usually occurs within 12 hours, but can occur days later. In postpolypectomy syndrome, however, there is no free air on abdominal x-rays or CT. CT Imaging A commonly shows focal thickening of the colonic wall and B pericolic and perifarmiat fat stranding. The treatment is C"

        "explanation": "Answer: E, Sesap14 category 12 part I Q17. Desmoid tumors may develop in as many as 10% to 15% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and are probably the leading cause of death in FAP patients who have undergone colectomy. These tumors are typically abdominal, but can occur on the trunk and body, particularly following abdominal operations. Specific mutations in the APC gene responsible for FAP are also responsible for desmoid tumor development and proliferation. Desmoid tumors have an unpredictable natural history: 10% regress spontaneously, 30% have cyclical growth and regression, 50% remain stable, and 10% grow rapidly. In tumors that can be safely removed, surgical excision is recommended. For large rapidly progressive tumors, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, sulindac, has been used to control disease. Multiple chemotherapy and radiotherapy is reserved for large progressive tumors deemed inoperable due to extent of disease. Based on his history, examination, and ultrasound findings, the mass is not an incisional hernia or lipoma. Infiltrating desmoid tumor would be expected to be painful, symptomatic and tender on examination. Patients with FAP are at risk for both colonic and small bowel adenocarcinoma; however, adenocarcinoma involving the abdominal wall would be a feature of this syndrome. 2014"

        "explanation": "Answer: A, Hopkins ABSITE 2e p89. The spleen is a secondary organ of the immune system. Encapsulated pathogens are opsonized and then cleared from circulation by the spleen. Therefore, asplenic patients are primarily at risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) caused by encapsulated organisms. Asplenic adults are at 40% to 60% greater risk of sepsis compared with nonsplenectomy adults. However, the risk of OPSI in patients undergoing splenectomy for hematologic disease is 1% in comparison to the higher rates seen in patients after splenectomy for trauma. The risk and impact of OPSI is in- versely related to age. In 80% of cases, OPSI occurs within the first 2 years after splenectomy. The risk of OPSI is further increased in asplenic patients with malignancy, hematological disorders such as thalassemia, or the immunosuppressed (e.g., those undergoing chemotherapy). Overall, OPSI has a 50% to 60% mortality rate. The most common organisms that cause OPSI are as follows, in order of decreasing frequency: S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus sp., S. aureus, E. coli, Pseudo- monas sp. Guidelines for reduction of the risk of OPSI focuses on immunization of patients undergoing elective splenectomy with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine 10 to 14 days before surgery. Those undergoing splenectomy for trauma should receive the immunization 14 days post-operatively. Booster immunization is recommended every 3 years. In addition, vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccines for H. influenzae type B, meningococcus, and annually for influenza is recommended and man-dated for immunosuppressed patients and those younger than 10 years. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis such as dental work. Patient education is important following splenectomy. Asplenic patients should be encouraged to carry identification cards to alert health care workers and should be advised to take every sign of early infection very seriously."

The best method of preventing occupational HBV infection is to vaccinate all HCWs at risk if they do not have natural immunity from previous infection. When exposure occurs, the affected area should be immediately and thoroughly washed with soap and water. The source is tested for HBV, HCV, and HIV. If the source tests positive for HBV, nonimmune individuals are given HBIG for passive prophylaxis and are vaccinated. If a previously vaccinated individual incurs a needle injury, titers should be checked and a dose of vaccine given if titers are not detected. Interferon is not used for prophylaxis following acute exposure but may be useful for some patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection."

        "explanation": "The floor of the mouth is a subsite of the oral cavity. The staging system used is the same as for all other cancers of the oral cavity. In this patient, although the size (2 to 4 cm) would stage it as a T2 cancer, invasion into cortical bone qualifies as T4 disease. The floor of the mouth is defined anatomically as extending from the lower alveolar ridge to the ventral surface of the tongue. Posteriorly, it is bounded by the anterior tonsillar pillars. Overall, treatment of cancer in the floor of the mouth is primarily surgical. Radiation therapy is less effective in patients with deep invasion of bone or muscle, as in this patient. Primary radiation treatment carries the risk of osteoradionecrosis. Surgical resection involving the floor of the mouth, tongue, and mandible is classically referred to as a \"composite\" or \"commando\" resection and includes segmental mandibulectomy and neck dissection."

        "explanation": "Hashimoto disease is a type of autoimmune thyroiditis. Histologically, the gland exhibits a dense lymphocytic infiltrate associated with dense fibrosis. When the disease is active, patients can experience symptoms associated with either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The natural progression of the disease is the eventual development of a multinodular goiter associated with hypothyroidism. Surgery is rarely indicated except in the setting of (1) debilitating symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, (2) compressive symptoms from multinodular goiter, and (3) suspicion of malignancy. The presence of nodular disease mandates FNA to rule out lymphoma or papillary cancer. For reasons that are unclear, hypothyroidism in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis is more common in men than in women."

        "explanation": "Flail chest is diagnosed in the presence of paradoxical respiratory movement in a portion of the chest wall. At least two fractures in each of three adjacent rib or costal cartilages are required to produce this condition. Complications of flail chest include segmental pulmonary hypoventilation with subsequent infection and ultimately respiratory failure. Management of flail chest should be individualized. If adequate pain control and pulmonary toilet can be provided, patients may be managed without stabilization of the flail. Often, intercostal nerve blocks and tracheostomy aid in this form of management. If stabilization is required, external methods such as sandbags or towel clips are no longer used. Surgical stabilization with wires is used if thoracotomy is to be performed for another indication. If this is not the case, \"internal\" stabilization is performed by placing the patient on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure. Tracheostomy is recommended because these patients usually require 10-14 days to stabilize their flail segment and post-ventilation pulmonary toilet is simplified by tracheostomy. Indications for mechanical ventilation include significant impedance to ventilation by the flail segment, large pulmonary contusion, an uncooperative patient (e.g., owing to head injury), general anesthesia for another indication, more than five ribs fractured, and the development of respiratory failure."

Once the clot has formed, neither warfarin nor heparin are suitable as initial therapy for the condition. Fibrinolytic drugs are given once a clot is formed. Fibrinolytic drugs are used, for example, to reperfuse the myocardium by dissolving the thrombus blocking the coronary arteries and in massive pulmonary embolism. This process is called 'thrombolysis'. Thrombolysis requires the use of thrombolytic or fibrinolytic drugs, which are either derived from Streptomyces species or (more recently) by recombinant technology, where human activators of plasminogen (eg tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) are manufactured by bacteria. Some commonly used thrombolytics are: Streptokinase, Urokinase, Alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or rtPA), Reteplase, Tenecteplase. All thrombolytic agents work by activating the enzyme plasminogen, which clears the cross-linked fibrin mesh (the backbone of a clot). This makes the clot soluble and subject to further proteolysis by other enzymes, and restores blood flow in occluded blood vessels."

        "answerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "A traumatic diaphragmatic rupture typically results from the rapid increase in intraabdominal pressure related to an episode of blunt trauma with subsequent rupture of the diaphragm. The diagnosis may be difficult in part because the force of injury is likely to result in multiple organ damage. A traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is more commonly diagnosed on the left side, and the stomach is the most common organ involved. Right diaphragmatic injuries are rarely diagnosed in the early postinjury period (Symbas et al., 1986). The liver often prevents herniation of other abdominal organs into the chest. The chest radiograph will often be missed initially if the film is misinterpreted as showing an elevated diaphragm, acute gastric dilatation, a loculated pneumomethorax, or subpulmonary hematoma. Often times the chest radiograph will show opacification within the affected pleural cavity, air fluid levels, and mediastinal shift. If a laceration of the left diaphragm is suspected, a nasogastric tube should be inserted.

        "explanation": "Basal skull fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical signs. CT scan findings include linear lucencies through the skull base, pneumocephalus, and opacification of air sinuses. Clinical signs vary depending on the site of fracture. Anterior skull base fractures may cause anosmia, CSF rhinorrhea, and periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes). Middle fossa or temporal bone fractures may result in ecchymosis over the mastoids (Battle\u2019s sign), see Fig. 36-6), hemotympanum, CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea, and cranial nerve VII or VIII palsies. A dilated and nonreactive pupil is often the result of compression of cranial nerve III, causing interruption of the sympathetic fibers traveling along this nerve. This is most often a sign of elevated ICP and not of a basal skull fracture, although related trauma to the orbit could result in a dilated and nonreactive pupil. Other consequences of basal skull fractures include optic nerve injury, abducens nerve injury, traumatic carotid artery aneurysms, carotid cavernous fistulae, CSF fistulae, meningitis, and cerebral abscess. Temporal bone fractures may be divided into two categories based on the relationship between the fracture line and the long axis of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The longitudinal pattern entails a fracture that is parallel to the long axis of petrous bone. The fracture is usually through the petrosquamosal suture and often passes between the cochlea and semicircular canals, sparing cranial nerves VII and VIII. It is more common (70-90% of all cases) than the transverse fracture pattern, which is, in contrast, perpendicular to long axis of petrous bone. Absence of brainstem function are dilated and nonreactive pupils, absent corneal reflexes, absent oculocephalic (doll's eyes) reflex, absent oculo vestibular reflex, and absent oropharyngeal (gag) reflex."

Another study demonstrated that only 40% of patients with a pancreatic injury had an elevated amylase level (Moretz et al., 1975). Also, elevated amylase levels have been documented frequently in patients with isolated head injuries where there is no evidence of abdominal trauma (Vitale et al., 1987).

Blunt aortic injuries may be partial thickness, histologically similar to an intimal tear in aortic dissection, or full thickness and therefore equivalent to ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is contained by surrounding tissues (Williams et al., 1994). The hallmark radiographic sign is a widened mediastinum seen on chest radiograph, related to advential hematoma. Other findings include obliteration of the aortic knob, deviation of the trachea to the right, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, obliteration of the space between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, widened paratracheal stripe, presence of a pleural or apical cap. When the initial chest x-ray demonstrates findings suggestive of a mediastinal hematoma some clinicians require additional screening by CT scan to delineate changes seen on chest radiography and to substantiate a request for a diagnostic arteriogram. The gold standard for the diagnosis, however, remains arterial angiography. It allows precise localization of the injury and provides information regarding vascular anatomy and other factors that profoundly influence operative strategy (Moore, Feliciano, and Mattox, 2004). Transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation (TEE) contains numerous poorly visualized areas of the aorta, thus a negative TEE does not rule out an aortic injury (Horton et al., 2000). Initial treatment involves permitting moderate hypotension (SBP 80\u2013100 mmHg) and limiting fluid administration until operative control is achieved. Currently, it is difficult to make substantiated recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in patients with suspected or proven blunt aortic injury. While retrospective studies suggest that it is safe, no prospective studies have demonstrated either safety or superiority of such treatment (Moore, Feliciano, and Mattox, 2004)."

        "explanation": "The mobilization of the spleen is performed in a stepwise approach to avoid further injury and provide improved visualization of the left hemidiaphragm, left kidney, and posterior distal pancreas and spleen (see Fig. 8-23). The first step is to divide the splenorenal and splenophrenic ligaments initially by sharp dissection and continue with sharp and blunt dissection. Once these lateral attachments are divided, mobilizing the spleen and tail of the pancreas medially is the next step. The two structures should be moved as a unit to avoid any injuries to either structure. The next step is to clamp and tie of the short gastric vessels. Avoid dividing these vessels with only scissors or Bovie electrocautery because of the risk of delayed bleeding. The last step is to divide the splenocolic ligament. If bleeding is encountered during removal of the spleen, digital compression is preferred. Mass clamping of the hilum should be reserved for instances of extreme hemorrhage because of the increased risk for damage of the tail of the pancreas during this maneuver."

        "explanation": "Gastric lavage is not indicated in this patient and is not a proven benefit, even when used within 1 hour of ingestion. Complications can include aspiration, laryngospasm, and mechanical injury. Ipecac causes local irritation of the gastric mucosa, which induces reflex vomiting after 30 minutes of administration. Ipecac should not be used in routine poisoning cases; there is no evidence that it improves outcomes, and it can do more harm by exposing the esophagus to the poison again. Whole-bowel irrigation is not specifically indicated for any poisoning but at times can be used with medications that are sustained-release or enteric coated drugs, such as lithium, which our patient ingested. Activated charcoal is best given within 1 hour of ingestion and can be considered if the patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of poison. There is no evidence showing that activated charcoal improves outcomes. The most likely diagnosis is a catheter-related bloodstream infection. He had a catheter placed on an emergency basis and is now experiencing fevers and malaise, with cellulitis evident in the right side of his neck. His infection can explain the anorexia, illness, and elevated WBC count. Catheter-related bloodstream infection is seen in approximately 5% of patients with indwelling catheters and should be suspected if any erythema or purulence is identified at the catheter site. The subclavian vein is the preferred site for reduction of infection, over internal jugular or femoral locations. Once an infection is suspected, blood should be drawn through the line and peripherally for culture, and immediate removal of the catheter is suggested and the tip sent for culture. A catheter-peripheral colony forming unit (CFU) ratio of 8 signifies line sepsis, and a catheter tip culture with 25 CFUs confirms a catheter-related infection."

        "explanation": "Neurogenic shock refers to a condition characterized by hypotension and bradycardia that results from the interruption of the sympathetic nervous system pathways within the spinal cord. Common causes include sensory stimulation, such as severe pain, exposure to unpleasant events or sights, high spinal anesthesia, and traumatic spinal cord injury. Clinical characteristics include a BP that is often low, as in other forms of shock. However, the pulse rate is usually slower than normal, and the skin is flushed, warm, and dry. CO is reduced secondary to decreased blood return to the heart because of the increased capacitance of the arterioles and venules. Since the heart receives sympathetic input, there is a difference between injuries above and below T4. The former depresses cardiac function and decreases venous return. The bradycardia is caused by sympathectomy of the spinal injury above the level of T4 with no capacity for compensatory tachycardia. Treatment of neurogenic shock secondary to spinal cord injury is usually more complicated, not only because of more prolonged hypotension but also because of the presence of coincident hypovolemic shock resulting from associated injuries. Such patients often require ventilatory support as a result of decreased spontaneous respiration and loss of the accessory muscles for breathing. Aggressive fluid therapy should be instituted early under continuous cardiovascular monitoring. Persistent hypotension necessitates recognition of possible hemorrhagic shock, and a vasopressor such as ephedrine or phenylephrine may be needed. If the injury is below T4, a pure \u03b1-agonist may aggravate the reflex bradycardia. Thus a drug with mixed chronotropic and inotropic effects (e.g., norepinephrine or dopamine) is preferred. A nasogastric tube should be inserted because gastric atony, dilation, and hypersecretion develop in these patients. Treatment of milder forms of neurogenic shock consists of removing the nociceptive stimulus. Neurogenic shock resulting from high spinal anesthesia can usually be treated with a vasopressor such as ephedrine or phenylephrine, each of which increases CO by direct effects on the heart and by increasing peripheral vasoconstriction. Although the administration of steroids remains controversial, their usefulness for blunt spinal cord injury has been suggested when they are given within 8 h of injury and their administration is extended for 48 h."

Although mechanical ventilatory support is often required to support oxygenation and ventilation after major trauma with multiple injuries, it is not mandatory for management of the flail. Sufficient attention to pain control and pulmonary toilet may help to avert intubation and mechanical ventilatory support in patients with isolated chest wall injury. Epidural analgesia markedly improves outcomes and reduces the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly in the elderly. Aggressive pulmonary toilet with support of an effective cough avoids further atelectasis and maintains functional residual vital capacity as well as secretion clearance. Corticosteroids offer no benefit and the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with chest trauma and chest tubes remains controversial. Meta-analysis of randomized studies assessing the use of prophylactic antibiotics suggests that the frequency of posttraumatic empyema and pneumonia can be decreased when antibiotics are used (7.6% to 15% for empyema, 16% to 7.6% for pneumonia)."

The Brain Trauma Foundation 2007 guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) initially recommended goal tube feedings be achieved by day 7. This recommendation was amended to day 5 in 2008. Goal feeding within 5 days after TBI is an independent factor affecting mortality, even after controlling for other factors such as hypotension, age, CT diagnosis, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score. Patients not fed within 5 to 7 days had a two to fourfold increased likelihood of mortality. Peripheral caloric support at day 1 would be inadequate and inappropriate at a time when dramatic volume changes and volume resuscitation is warranted. Feeding of any type beginning at day 5 is unlikely to achieve goal rates in a rapid enough time course to have an impact. Feedings beginning at day 3 are most likely to achieve goal rate by day 5.

        ],
        "answerIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "The large number of fluid resuscitation formulae in common use is attributed to the fact that no formula accurately predicts fluid requirements in every patient. No formula can replace a physician at the bedside repeatedly evaluating the patient's physiology through the resuscitative period. A reasonable consensus formula is the Modified Brooke formula, however, regardless of the formula chosen to initiate resuscitation, subsequent fluid administration is best guided by regular assessment of the resuscitation end points, rather than prediction of any formula. Vasoactive mediators released from the injured tissue result in diffuse capillary leaks seen shortly after major burn injury with resulting extravasation of both crystalloid and colloid for the first 18 to 24 hours after burn. The pathophysiology explains the enormous volume requirements seen in such patients and is the reason that most resuscitative formulae withhold colloid until 24 hours post-injury. Children have been found to commonly require fluid in excess of that predicted by several formulae."

The Abb\u00e9 flap was originally designed to reconstruct central upper lip (tubercle) defects with lower lip full-thickness tissue vascularized by one of the labial arteries. The technique requires a second-stage procedure for division of the pedicle.

        ],
        "answerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "Various open approaches have traditionally been used for adrenal tumors requiring operation. However, these lesions are usually small and situated deep in the retroperitoneum, making them well suited to a laparoscopic approach. Snow and colleagues performed the first successful transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and the lateral transabdominal approach for laparoscopic adrenalectomy was popularized in 1992. Since these initial reports, several studies have demonstrated the safety and advantages of laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and it has become the procedure of choice for the surgical management of many adrenal neoplasms. Recent reports have demonstrated that laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytomas can be accomplished safely by experienced surgeons. Adrenocortical carcinomas are characterized by large adrenal masses with invasion of adjacent structures requiring multi-visceral resection to achieve a negative margin and prevent local recurrence and subsequent cancer-related death. Although some early reports suggest that selected patients with primary adrenal malignancies can undergo laparoscopic adrenalectomy with acceptable results, there are too few patients with malignant adrenocortical carcinoma histology in these series to recommend routine use of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for patients with this disease. The adrenals can be removed laparoscopically via a transabdominal (anterior or lateral) or retroperitoneal (lateral or posterior) approach. The anterior transabdominal approach gives a conventional view of the abdominal cavity and allows a bilateral adrenalectomy to be performed without the necessity of repositioning the patient. However, it requires insertion of additional ports and has been reported to be associated with increased operative times. The lateral approach is the most widely used method and provides the largest working space because gravity aids retraction of surrounding organs. Patients need to be repositioned for a bilateral procedure. During the procedure, the right adrenal vein is identified at its junction with the inferior vena cava (figure), ligated with clips, and divided using endoscopic scissors."

        "explanation": "In the mid-1990s, as surgeons were actively expanding the envelope for laparoscopic surgery, disturbing reports of problems with laparoscopic resection of colonic malignancies began to surface. Of particular concern were case reports of port site metastases in up to 20% of cases, as compared with an historical rate of only 1% in conventional laparotomy incisions. Concern was also expressed regarding the completeness of oncologic resection possible with the techniques and surgical skills of that era. A national moratorium was advised until prospective trials could demonstrate safety and efficacy. Trials comparing laparoscopic and open resections were completed and reported in 2004. They indicated that postoperative recovery is significantly faster in the laparoscopic group; recurrence rates in surgical wounds were less than 1% regardless of approach; in each group, the median number of nodes retrieved was 12; complications occurred with equal frequency; and overall survival was similar. Laparoscopic colon surgery is technically demanding, and operative times are significantly longer. Obesity and previous abdominal operation increase difficulty, operating times, and conversion to open resection. Long operating times associated with laparoscopy may be inadvisable in the very elderly and/or infirm, but age is not an absolute contraindication."

        "explanation": "The incidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH) is 1 in 2000 to 5000 births. The cause of this sporadic developmental anomaly is unknown. The most common CDH is hernia of Bochdalek, which occurs on the left side in 80% of cases and involves a posterolateral defect in the diaphragm. Morgagni's foramen are small triangular areas at the anterior aspect of the diaphragm on either side of the inferior end of the sternum. Morgagni hernia is a congenital defect between the costal and sternal portions of the diaphragm muscle. Morgagni hernias make up 3% of all diaphragmatic hernias. They occur far more commonly on the right side (91%) despite protection from the liver. The defect itself usually has a greater transverse dimension than the anteroposterior dimension. Morgagni hernias occur more commonly in women (62%) than men. The average patient age at presentation is 53. The average age at presentation is 58 for women and 50 for men. In women, 15% of cases present between 56 and 60 years of age; men have a more bimodal distribution, with peaks at 31 to 35 and 66 to 70. The most common symptoms are pressure in the chest or abdomen (37%) followed closely by pulmonary symptoms (36%); 28% of patients are asymptomatic at presentation and the hernia is usually found on chest x-ray. Acute presentations occur more frequently in children. Morgagni hernias can be repaired via laparotomy, thoracotomy, thoracoscopy. Surgical repair is indicated in all cases due to incarceration.

If necessary, the bile ducts can be evaluated without risk to the fetus by magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC). If MRC demonstrates the presence of common bile ducts stones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be performed with shielding of the fetus.

        "answerIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "Although third-party payers have begun taking steps to limit eligibility of patients, both laparoscopic and open Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses are being performed in record numbers. Laparoscopic and open procedures have equivalent effectiveness of weight loss, anastomotic leak rates, and in most studies, mortality. Mortality has been higher for open procedures in some studies. Wound complications, specifically wound infection and incisional hernia, are more prevalent with open procedures, and hospital stay is predictably longer. The laparoscopic approach requires slightly longer operative times and is costlier, although overall hospital costs are equivalent for both approaches because of the shortened stay after laparoscopic bypass. Bowel obstruction is also more common, likely due to the higher incidence of internal hernias seen after laparoscopic procedures. Internal hernia occurs after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through three defects: at the jejunojejunal anastomosis, at the opening in the transverse mesocolon through which the retrocolic Roux limb is passed, and behind the Roux limb (Petersen hernia). The laparoscopic approach has a higher rate of internal hernia because these defects are more difficult to close laparoscopically and also because adhesion formation is decreased compared with the open procedure. The incidence of internal hernia is lower when the Roux limb is placed in an antecolic position. Diagnosis of internal hernia requires a high index of suspicion. Internal hernia can cause chronic abdominal pain (typically periumbilical) and can be difficult to diagnose because contrast studies and computed tomography (CT) are often normal. Left untreated, internal hernia can lead to bowel obstruction and/or small bowel necrosis. Most repairs can be performed laparoscopically."

        "explanation": "Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is one of the most common surgical conditions of infancy. It occurs in 1\u20133 of every 1000 live births. Boys are affected four times more often than girls. Pathogenesis involves pyloric muscle fiber hypertrophy causing a mechanical obstruction of the gastric outlet. The etiology of HPS remains elusive but family history, sex, birth order, and maternal feeding patterns all have been implicated. Various theories support the pathophysiology of HPS including compensatory work hypertrophy, neurodegeneration/immaturity, and abnormal endocrine signals. Some reports also link early erythromycin exposure and HPS. It is hypothesized that erythromycin interacts with motilin receptors inducing pyloric contractions that result in hypertrophy. HPS most commonly develops from 2 to 12 weeks (peak incidence of 3\u20136 weeks) of age in an otherwise healthy infant who feeds normally at birth. A pattern of vomiting ensues which varies but classically progresses to projectile nonbilious emesis. Diagnosis of HPS is primarily made by history and physical. Physical examination findings include peristaltic waves in the epigastric area and the presence of a palpable mass in the upper abdomen (Figs. 34-24 and 34-25). The absence of these findings with a strong history of HPS should prompt an US or an UGI contrast study. US criteria include a pyloric muscle thickness >4 mm, pyloric muscle diameter >14 mm, and a channel length >17 mm, but are adjusted by age. If US is nondiagnostic, an UGI contrast study can aid in ruling out reflux, malrotation, or obstruction. UGI finding consistent with HPS include a \u201cstring\u201d sign, a \u201cdouble track\u201d sign, or \u201cshoulders\u201d at the proximal end of the pyloris.

        "answerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "Jaundice in the newborn period is a relatively common occurrence in infants. For many newborn infants, jaundice may represent a manifestation of an ongoing adaptation to the extrauterine environment. Nevertheless, it cannot be automatically assumed to be a mild or physiologic condition. Generally, jaundice refers to an elevated blood concentration of bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia can be due to indirect or accumulation of unconjugated, lipid soluble bilirubin pigment in the serum or be due to direct bilirubin or conjugated, water soluble form. When the serum concentration of conjugated bilirubin and/or bile salts is elevated, it denotes a pathologic state (cholestasis) of reduced bile flow. While initial workup for the jaundiced infant is medically oriented, surgeons should be aware of the wide differential diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice and be cognizant of the surgically treated causes of cholestasis (biliary atresia, choledochocysts, congenital anomalies of the biliary tree, and perforation of the common bile duct). Cholestasis may develop due to a variety of insults. These include drugs (flecanide), parenteral nutrition (most common cause in the NICU), ECMO, infectious agents (e.g., bacterial sepsis, viral causes, and toxoplasmosis), inherited/metabolic causes, endocrine abnormalities, and chromosomal aberrations (trisomies 18 and 21). For example, a lipid metabolic disorder such as Niemann-Pick\u2019s disease (NPD) (sphingomyelinase deficiency) can present with neonatal cholestasis. NPD is a heterogeneous group of lysosomal lipid storage diseases. Patients afflicted with NPD can present with neonatal cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and death between 3 and 9 months. Two metabolic classification groups exist: NP types A/B, which are primarily sphingomyelinase deficiencies, and type C, which refers to alterations of trafficking of endocytosed cholesterol. While liver pathology is unknown, histology resembles neonatal hepatitis. As the disease progresses, hepatic lobules become progressively distended with portal cholestasis. CF may be confused with inspissated bile syndrome or ductal atresia and causes neonatal cholestasis. CF is most commonly caused by a mutation which results in deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (delta F508 mutation). The gene product is cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) and mutation in the protein results in the impaired ability of CFTR to increase chloride channel activity that leads to paucity of water in mucous secretions. \u03b11AT deficiency results in neonatal cholestasis due to hepatocellular and bile duct injury. \u03b11AT deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children. \u03b11AT, a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily, is the principle blood borne inhibitor of destructive neutrophil proteases which include elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. Most \u03b11AT is synthesized in the liver where it translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When \u03b11AT associates with a binding protein, it can fold into its native conformation and traverse the secretory pathway. Mutations in the gene responsible for \u03b11AT result in misfolded molecules, which accumulate in the liver and cause hepatocyte injury due to resultant release of lysosomal enzymes and cause ductular proliferation and luminal bile plugging."

        "explanation": "Persistence of neonatal jaundice beyond 2 weeks of age or once biochemical tests have confirmed pathologic jaundice (conjugated bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL or over 15% of the total bilirubin concentration) warrants radiologic evaluation. US is usually the first modality used to evaluate pathologic jaundice. US can examine the liver, bile ducts, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen, and portal vein. In BA, US may show hepatomegaly and increasing echogenicity, a small or absent gall bladder, and nonvisible biliary ducts. The presence of polyspenia also supports the diagnosis. CC at US appear as simple cysts (I, II, and III) in the region of the gall bladder. The presence of a dilated extrahepatic biliary tree in conjunction with a cyst highly suggests this pathology. Depending on the type of choledochal cyst, other intrahepatic cysts may be shown on US. Cholithiasis and choledocholithiasis in the newborn period are rare and if suspected on US, stones appear as freely movable, bright echoic shadowing foci within the gall bladder lumen while bright echoic structures within the biliary ducts is usually associated with ductal dilatation (the common bile duct should measure less than 1 mm in neonates, less than 2 mm in infants up to 1-year-old, less than 4 mm in older children, and less than 7 mm in adolescents). In most cases of biliary dyskinesia, the US is normal. Suspected biliary fistulas should be evaluated in patients who have sustained hepatic injury or undergone recent hepatobiliary surgery. An US may show free intraperitoneal fluid and subsequent paracentesis would reveal biliary fluid. If US is unable to exclude hepatobiliary pathology, a nuclear hepatobiliary scan (HIDA scan) should be the next imaging test for studying the hepatic parenchyma and associated biliary tree. In BA, particularly early, the uptake of the nucleotide is rapid but excretion into the bowel is absent. Moreover, failure to show gut excretion is nondiagnostic and HIDA is unable to distinguish BA versus other causes of cholestasis. Cholangiography would be the next study to investigate exact areas in question; demonstration of duodenal contrast and intrahepatic ducts would exclude BA. In CC, HIDA and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) can be used after US in order to gain additional information concerning biliary anatomy. ERCP has the advantage of delineating biliary and pancreatic duct definition and may aid in preoperative decision making. In cases of suspected choledocholithiasis, the most favorable treatment in children remains controversial. Options include an open cholecystectomy with simultaneous common bile duct (CBD) exploration, laparoscopic cholecystectomy with preoperative/postoperative ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal, or laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic removal of CBD stones. Some consider the complication rate for pediatric ERCP higher and recommend strict selection criteria be done prior to subjecting a pediatric patient to ERCP, especially biliary lithiasis. The advent of cholecystokinin (CCK)-HIDA has made the diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia more accurately. Using CCK (peptide hormone produced by the I cells of duodenum and upper jejunum that acts on the gall bladder wall musculature) to stimulate the gall bladder measures the degree of emptying (ejection fraction). An ejection fraction of <35% denotes biliary dyskinesia. Cholecystectomy should be considered in children with chronic upper abdominal pain and delayed ejection fraction on CCK-HIDA scintigraphy. Hepatic biliary scanning (HIDA) is a sensitive test for documenting the presence or absence of biliary leaks (fistulas) because the tracer is concentrated and excreted into the biliary ductal system. Because it cannot pinpoint injuries to the extrahepatic ducts, cholangiography would be employed to detect exact injuries. In this case, US fails to show a detectable sonographic abnormality yet the HIDA scan demonstrates inability to visualize radiolabelled iminodiacetic acid derivative into the small intestine after 19h. The scan suggests a diagnosis of BA."

        ],
        "answerIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "Repair of pediatric hernias constitutes one of the most common congenital anomalies that pediatric surgeons are confronted with. The majority of inguinal hernias in infants and children are indirect and are a result of the failure of the processus vaginalis (a diverticulum of peritoneum) to involute as the process of gonad descent proceeds into the scrotum in males and the lower pelvis in females. The processus vaginalis is an anteromedial structure that appears to aid in testicular descent by providing the hydrolic force that positions the testis into the scrotum; it later regresses and thereby obliterates the entrance of the peritoneal cavity into the inguinal canal. Various other conditions are associated with inguinal hernias and include a positive family history, undescended testis (UDT), prematurity, ascites, hypospadias or epispadias, presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, misuse of continuous peritoneal dialysis, ambiguous genitalia, and children with connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos and Hunter-Suhle syndrome). Because this type of hernia will not close spontaneously and of the high risk of incarceration (especially in infants under 1 year of age), inguinal hernias should be repaired within 4 weeks of diagnosis. While repair of inguinal hernias involves high suture ligation of the sac at the level of the internal ring, the issue of contralateral exploration continues to be a subject of debate. There seems to have evolved a selective approach to managing the opposite groin based on age, gender, and patent processes vaginalis. In children less than 2 years of age, the patency of the PV is high and some advocate contralateral exploration because of the frequent occurrence of unsuspected hernias. Recent studies have not shown significant differences in determining the presence of a contralateral PPV in cases of unilateral inguinal hernia. Laparoscopy has aided in detection of a contralateral PPV. Yet the issue of a PPV is that it is a potential factor for inguinal hernia development, it does not represent a true hernia. Spontaneous closure occurs in the majority of cases (60% by 2 years of age) and it appears that not all PPVs develop into inguinal hernias. Nevertheless, some justify a contralateral exploration in children who are at high anesthetic risk, when distance and transportation issues may impede the return of an infant to the hospital, and if the child is at risk for subsequent development for an inguinal hernia (children with VP shunts, connective tissue disorders, family history of bilateral inguinal hernias). UH are a result of intestinal protrusion through an incompletely closed, contracting umbilical ring. Some conditions that predispose an infant to UH include low birth weight infants, Beckwith-Weidemann's syndrome (BWS), Down's syndrome, and ascites. Most UH close after birth and the risk of strangulation or incarceration is extremely low. Most pediatric surgeons defer treatment until 4 or 5 years of age before operating on asymptomatic patients. A relative surgical indication is related to size of the defect: a defect greater than 2 cm is not likely to close spontaneously. Additionally, elective repair is often sought when the patient will be undergoing"

        "answerIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "The thoracic aorta is particularly susceptible to injury from blunt trauma. These injuries usually involve proximal descending aorta (54-65% cases), but often involve other segments such as the ascending aorta or transverse aortic arch, and mid or distal descending thoracic aorta. The typical injury is seen when the mechanism of injury is rapid deceleration, resulting in differential forces on the proximal descending aorta between fixed and more mobile portions (Rogers et al., 1996). The most common site of injury is just beyond the ligamentum arteriosum. Blunt aortic injuries may be partial thickness, histologically similar to an intimal tear in aortic dissection, or full thickness and therefore equivalent to ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is contained by surrounding tissues (Williams et al., 1994). The hallmark radiographic sign is a widened mediastinum seen on chest radiograph, related to advential hematoma. Other findings include obliteration of the aortic knob, deviation of the trachea to the right, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, obliteration of the space between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, widened paratracheal stripe, presence of a pleural or apical cap. When the initial chest x-ray demonstrates findings suggestive of a mediastinal hematoma some clinicians require additional screening by CT scan to delineate changes seen on chest radiography and to substantiate a request for a diagnostic arteriogram. The gold standard for the diagnosis, however, remains arterial angiography. It allows precise localization of the injury and provides information regarding vascular anatomy and other factors that profoundly influence operative strategy (Moore, Feliciano, and Mattox, 2004). Transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation (TEE) contains numerous poorly visualized areas of the aorta, thus a negative TEE does not rule out an aortic injury (Horton et al., 2000). Initial treatment involves permitting moderate hypotension (SBP 80-100 mmHg) and limiting fluid administration until operative control is achieved. Currently, it is difficult to make substantiated recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in patients with suspected or proven blunt aortic injury. While retrospective studies suggest that it is safe, no prospective studies have demonstrated either safety or"

        "explanation": "The mobilization of the spleen is performed in a stepwise approach to avoid further injury and provide improved visualization of the left hemidiaphragm, left kidney, and posterior distal pancreas and spleen (see Fig. 8-23). The first step is to divide the splenorenal and splenophrenic ligaments initially by sharp dissection and continue with sharp and blunt dissection. Once these lateral attachments are divided, mobilizing the spleen and tail of the pancreas medially is the next step. The two structures should be moved as a unit to avoid any injuries to either structure. The next step is to clamp and tie of the short gastric vessels. Avoid dividing these vessels with only scissors or Bovie electrocautery because of the risk of delayed bleeding. The last step is to divide the splenocolic ligament. If bleeding is encountered during removal of the spleen, digital compression is preferred. Mass clamping of the hilum should be reserved for instances of extreme hemorrhage because of the increased risk for damage of the tail of the pancreas during this maneuver."

        "explanation": "Neurogenic shock refers to a condition characterized by hypotension and bradycardia that results from the interruption of the sympathetic nervous system pathways within the spinal cord. Common causes include sensory stimulation, such as severe pain, exposure to unpleasant events or sights, high spinal anesthesia, and traumatic spinal cord injury. Clinical characteristics include a BP that is often low, as in other forms of shock. However, the pulse rate is usually slower than normal, and the skin is flushed, warm, and dry. CO is reduced secondary to decreased blood return to the heart because of the increased capacitance of the arterioles and venules. Since the heart receives sympathetic input, there is a difference between injuries above and below T4. The former depresses cardiac function and decreases venous return. The bradycardia is caused by sympathectomy of the spinal injury above the level of T4 with no capacity for compensatory tachycardia. Treatment of neurogenic shock secondary to spinal cord injury is usually more complicated not only because of more prolonged hypotension but also because of the presence of coincident hypovolemic shock resulting from associated injuries. Such patients often require ventilatory support as a result of decreased spontaneous respiration and loss of the accessory muscles for breathing. Aggressive fluid therapy should be instituted early under continuous cardiovascular monitoring. Persistent hypotension necessitates recognition of possible hemorrhagic shock, and a vasopressor such as ephedrine or phenylephrine may be needed. If the injury is below T4, a pure \u03b1-agonist may aggravate the reflex bradycardia. Thus a drug with mixed chronotropic and inotropic effects (e.g., norepinephrine or dopamine) is preferred. A nasogastric tube should be inserted because gastric atony, dilation, and hypersecretion develop in these patients. Treatment of milder forms of neurogenic shock consists of removing the nociceptive stimulus. Neurogenic shock resulting from high spinal anesthesia can usually be treated with a vasopressor such as ephedrine or phenylephrine, each of which increases CO by direct effects on the heart and by increasing peripheral vasoconstriction. Although the administration of steroids remains controversial, their usefulness for blunt spinal cord injury has been suggested when they are given within 8 h of injury and their administration is extended for 48 h."

The defect itself usually has a greater transverse dimension than the anteroposterior dimension Morgagni hernias occur more commonly in women (62%) than men. The average patient age at presentation is 53. The average age at presentation is 58 for women and 50 for men. In women, 15% of cases present between 56 and 60 years of age; men have a more bimodal distribution, with peaks at 31 to 35 and 66 to 70.

She has been undergoing the long operation and most complications could be peritonitis, abscess, or anastomosis leakage. CT scan confirms signs of pelvic abscess. A CT scan can detect the presence of abscess, fluid collections, and other complications after colorectal surgery. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in early postoperative period due to risk of perforation. Blood culture and plain X-ray have limited sensitivity.

It is more common in patients with chronic biliary inflammation associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and other factors. The level of serum CA 19-9 is helpful in diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma. The pathology and clinical presentation is variable and includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other types. Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis, choledochal cysts, hepatolithiasis, liver fluke infection, and bile duct papillomatosis among others.

Lange5 net\nInvolvement of the superior mesenteric artery by a pancreatic tumor precludes resection for cure and therefore is a contraindication to proceeding with a Whipple procedure or pancreaticoduodenectomy. Involvement of the superior mesenteric vein does not necessarily preclude resection for cure as 2 to 3 cm of the portal vein/superior mesenteric vein can be resected and an end-to-end anastomosis or venous bypass be performed. Pyloric preservation is a well-excepted modification of the Whipple procedure. Total pancreatectomy is reserved for patients with extensive low-grade or cystic intraductal papillary lesions involving most of the pancreas. Preoperative biliary stenting is controversial with regard to risk of increased infectious complications postoperatively and preoperative stenting does not improve survival."

        "explanation": "Obstruction of the cystic duct may be caused by factors other than stones. Acalculous cholecystitis carries a high mortality because it occurs in patients who are already critically ill. Furthermore, the establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed. Urgent cholecystostomy should be performed. In recent years, percutaneous cholecystostomy under CT or ultrasonography (US) guidance is performed more commonly than surgical cholecystectomy, because it carries a lower operative mortality rate. In a stable patient, cholecystectomy may be considered."

        "explanation": "More than 90% of gastrinomas have receptors for somatostatin. Octreotide scanning (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy) has been shown to be the most sensitive test for localization of gastrinomas. However, successful localization depends on size and location. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is poor for very small (<1.1 cm) tumors and for small primary duodenal tumors. Duodenal gastrinomas are best."

        "answerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "The treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is generally medical. Corticosteroids achieve a response in about two thirds of patients. Intravenous IgG and plasmapheresis have also been used acutely to increase platelet levels in patients with bleeding due to severely reduced platelet counts (typically several with platelet counts <20,000/\u03bcL). Spontaneous bleeding with a platelet count above this level is unusual, and platelet transfusion is not needed. Intravenous IgG and plasmapheresis have only short-term effects, and are not definitive treatment for thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of ITP might be in doubt, but the presence of an accessory spleen must first be excluded. The presence of splenic tissue can be diagnosed by examination of the blood smear for Howell-Jolly bodies, which appear in the red cells of asplenic patients. Persistent splenic tissue can be confirmed by a technetium radionuclide scan. There is no indication that this patient is at risk for thrombotic events, and aspirin is not indicated."

        "answerIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "Acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by gallstones or alcohol consumption. Most episodes are self-limited and leave the patient without significant morbidity or mortality. However, in 15% to 20% of cases severe acute pancreatitis leads to systemic organ failure and local complications such as pancreatic pseudocyst, intra-abdominal or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pancreatic or enteric fistulas, and pancreatic necrosis. Necrotizing pancreatitis is defined as pancreatitis with devitalized or nonviable tissue. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast and thin cuts through the pancreas can determine whether nonviable pancreatic tissue is present. If pancreatic necrosis is present, then image-guided aspiration of the nonenhancing pancreas is helpful to determine whether pancreatic necrosis is infected or noninfected. If bacteria grow from the aspirate culture in a patient with worsening sepsis or multiorgan system failure, operation is indicated. Surgical debridement of the pancreas can be performed through an open midline incision. The lesser sac is entered and the pancreas is gently debrided along with the left and retroperitoneum region, which can also be necrotic. Multiple debridements in the operating room may be required until thick necrotic tissue is removed. Some surgeons place irrigation catheters, whereas others place large drains after the debridement. Image-guided percutaneous drainage of the pancreas can be effective for a pancreatic abscess, but is not necrotic pancreatic tissue can only be debrided operatively. This patient with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and infected ERCP, percutaneous drainage, and distal pancreatectomy is not indicated."

        "explanation": "Answer: A Sexsp14 categ9.11 q33 Pancreatic trauma is relatively uncommon in children, and pancreatic duct trauma is even less likely (0.12%). Diagnosis and treatment are controversial. The initial CT often misses injuries, and a repeat scan may be necessary. If the exists, an ERCP should be obtained. ERCP allows stenting partial pancreatic duct transection. Complete transactions usually not amenable to management with pancreatic duct placement. The treatment for complete transections is controversial. Distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation is the best treatment for pancreatic transection in the midbody. The overall complication rate and length of stay are lower with other treatments. The risk of diabetes is small, and the risk of long-term infection is low if the spleen is preserved. Six authors have proposed long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This is a long and arduous process compared operation, and does not result in better long-term function distal duct and pancreas often atrophy, and patients may multiple catheters for drainage of pancreatic fluid. Proxima distal pancreaticojejunostomies, preserving all pancr tissue, have also been proposed, but are associated with a higher complication rate than distal pancreatectomy. Principles anastomosis is usually not possible for these injuries."

        "explanation": "Malrotation includes a number of midgut congenital abnormalities resulting from improper rotation and fixation during gestation and occurs at a rate of 1 in 500 live births. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study is the preferred modality for diagnosis because the plain films rarely are suggestive of malrotation and other imaging methods are less sensitive or less specific. Immediate diagnostic imaging is indicated for any infant with bilious vomiting."

        "answerIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "Mullerian and mesonephric vestiges are common on both the testis and epididymis. Many of these appendices are pedunculated, making them more prone to torsion and infarction. Because many are Mullerian duct remnants, the peak incidence for clinical presentation of a torsed appendix is just before puberty, coinciding with a physiologic estrogen surge. The mullerian remnants become swollen and top heavy, and more susceptible to torsion. Pain is the common presenting symptom, often with gradual onset and relative mildness. There may be considerable delay before the child is brought to emergency department because symptoms do not subside. A careful examination may reveal a firm, exquisitely tender, pea-sized nodule in the upper scrotum attached to the epididymis or testis. Diagnosis is safe using Doppler ultrasound confirming the testis is not torsed. Treatment consists of analgesics."
